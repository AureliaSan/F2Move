# F2Move

This is a try for a technical test for Free2Move. I started with creating and inserting Data in PostgreSQL. I created 4 tables :

- Products
- Items
- Orders
- Customers
I started to clean the datasets and exported them as csv files.

To create the python file "TEST_F2M", I used Jupyter Noteboook.
